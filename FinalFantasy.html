    <div class="introtext1"> <h1>Final Fantasy XVI</h1>
        <p> is an upcoming action role-playing game developed and published by Square Enix for the PlayStation 5. It is the sixteenth title in the mainline Final Fantasy series. 
            The game is being produced by Naoki Yoshida and directed by Hiroshi Takai. <br> The game is set in the fictional land of Valisthea, 
            a continent with six factions that is on the verge of conflict due to a spreading malady called the Blight. <br> 
            The game is set in the fantasy world of Valisthea, where the people live comfortably thanks to mountains of crystal called the Mothercrystals. 
            The world is controlled by six factions:
             <ul>
                <li>The Grand Duchy of Rosaria.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Holy Empire of Sanbreque.</li>
                <br>
                <li>The Kingdom of Waloed.</li>
                <br>
                <li>The Dhalmekian Republic.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Iron Kingdom, and the Crystalline Dominion.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    </div>

     <div class="introtext2">
         <p> A central part of the plot is Eikons, summoned monsters controlled by or manifesting through humans called Dominants. 
             The main cast includes Clive Rosfield, the firstborn son of the Archduke of Rosaria who embarks on a quest for revenge after tragic events involving the dark Eikon Ifrit; Joshua Rosfield, Clive's younger brother, 
             Dominant of the Eikon Phoenix, and heir apparent to Rosaria; and Jill Warrick, a woman from the fallen Northern Territories who is Clive and Joshua's foster sister and confidant.
             Gameplay has Clive fighting using a combination of melee-based sword attacks and magical abilities. <br><br> Final Fantasy XVI is developed by Square Enix's Creative Business Unit III, the same division behind the development and maintenance of the MMORPG Final Fantasy XIV. 
             It is produced by Naoki Yoshida, director of Final Fantasy XIV; and directed by Hiroshi Takai, known for his work on the SaGa series and The Last Remnant. During the original announcement the game was also said to be developed for Microsoft Windows, this was later retracted, with Square Enix announcing it as a timed console exclusive for the PlayStation 5. 
             The game's release date has yet to be announced, and more information is planned to be revealed in 2021.

        <h1>Valisthea―A Land Blessed in the Light of the Mothercrystals.</h1>
        <p>The land of Valisthea is studded with Mothercrystals—glittering mountains of crystal that tower over the realms around them, blessing them with aether. 
            For generations, people have flocked to these beacons to take advantage of their blessing, using the aether to conjure magicks that let them live lives of comfort and plenty. 
            Great powers have grown up around each Mothercrystal, and an uneasy peace has long reigned between them. Yet now the peace falters as the spread of the Blight threatens to destroy their dominions.

        <h1>Eikons and Their Dominants. </h1>
        <p>The Eikons are the most powerful and deadly creatures in Valisthea. Each resides within a Dominant—a single man or woman who is blessed with the ability to call upon their dread power.
            In some nations these Dominants are treated as royalty in admiration of this strength—in others they are bound in fear of it, and forced to serve as weapons of war.
            Those who are born as Dominants cannot escape their fate, however cruel it may be.

        <h1>MESSAGES FROM THE DEVELOPERS.</h1>
        <p>When FINAL FANTASY I was released, I was just another player, a young student with big dreams.
            FINAL FANTASY XVI producer (that’s right, just producer) Naoki Yoshida here. 
            How did you enjoy the trailer? The exclusive footage, comprised of both battles and cutscenes running in real time, represents but a fraction of what our team has accomplished since the start of development on this,
            an all-new FINAL FANTASY game. In that span, the team’s size has grown from a handful of core members to a full-fledged unit that continues to polish and build upon what they have created so far,
            all to provide players an experience unmatched in terms of story and gameplay.
            Our next big information reveal is scheduled for 2021, so in the meantime, I expect everyone to have fun speculating, as we have a lot in store—not only for the newest entry in the series, 
            FINAL FANTASY XVI, but for FINAL FANTASY XIV, too. Needless to say, I’ll be working hard on both!
            <br> <br> <strong>- Producer Naoki Yoshida</strong> <br> <br>
            
            When FINAL FANTASY I was released, I was just another player─a young student with big dreams. By the time FINAL FANTASY V was in the works, 
            I had earned myself a seat at the developers’ table...albeit at the very end. From there, I moved “online,” leaving my mark on both FINAL FANTASY XI and XIV.
            And now...XVI.  From the establishment of an all new development environment, 
            to learning the ins and outs of the PS5, the team and I have taken upon countless challenges during our journey to bring you the sixteenth chapter in the storied FINAL FANTASY franchise.
            And though we're pouring our hearts and souls into this project each and every day, it may still be some time before we can get it into your hands. However I promise, the wait will be worth it!
