      <h3>Phantasy star online 1</h3>
      <img src="images/pso2Artwork/arks_logo.png">
      <p>Phantasy Star Online was a game released in 2000 for the Sega Dreamcast. 
        The game is a reboot with no canonical ties to the original series outside of some items, techniques, and enemies. 
        Unlike previous games, which were turn-based RPGs, the game is a hack and slash online RPG. Upon release, it was met 
        with very positive results and became a cult classic.</p>

      <h3>Phantasy star online 2</h3>
      <img src="images/pso2Artwork/arks_logo.png">
      <p>Phantasy Star Online 2 takes a departure from its predecessor by having its own continuity.
        Additionally, the story doesn't take place in a single planet or solar system; new planets to explore are added during the updates.
        The plot of PSO2 concerns an intergalactic colony fleet called Oracle that travels through deep-space in search of habitable planets.

        <p>The time for EPISODE 5 is drawing nigh, and operatives should prepare for its arrival on September 30th
            Finding yourself on a fog-enshrouded, flower-dotted plain, a strong sense of displacement and confusion fills you. You had been mid-battle with the Profound Darkness, yet again, in an attempt to sever its corruptive hold on Persona. 
            Suddenly, you feel the vibration of riders approaching, and spot a girl astride a scaled mount, 
            fleeing other riders atop similar beasts. A confrontation seems imminent, and you briefly have time to reflect on what this new mystery will bring in the way of adventure.
            Episode 5 brings quite a bit of new content and features, and though you have but a few moments before the party is upon you, you muse over the changes that are to take place on September 30th

        <p>You love your 14★ weapon, but as new enemies emerge in the story of Episode 5, you’re beginning to feel as though it’s time to bring out the bigger guns (or whatever weapon you choose to use).
        It’s time to upgrade, and there are so many things to consider, starting with which Weapon Series you want; the  15★ OPHISTIA SERIES, the 15★ TRAILBLAZER XION SERIES, 
        or the 15★ ATLAS EX SERIES. To help you decide that, let’s take a look at the weapons themselves and the Weapon Potentials of each series before we start looking at how to create them.
