      Souls is a series of action role-playing games developed by FromSoftware. The series began with the release of Demon's Souls for the PlayStation 3 in 2009, and was followed by Dark Souls and its sequels,
      Dark Souls II and Dark Souls III, in the 2010s. The series' creator, Hidetaka Miyazaki, served as director for each of them with the exceptions of Dark Souls II and the externally developed Demon's Souls remake.
      The Souls games are played in a third-person perspective, and focus on exploring interconnected environments while fighting enemies with weapons and magic. Players battle bosses to progress through the story,
      while interacting with strange non-playable characters. The series has been both praised and criticized for its high level of game difficulty. Other FromSoftware games such as: ing's Field, Bloodborne, Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, and Elden Ring share several related concepts. By 2020, the series had sold over 27 million copies.

          Dark Souls has been cited as one of the best video games of all time. Critics praised the depth of its combat, intricate level design, and use of flavor text. However, the game's difficulty received more mixed reviews, with some criticizing it for being too unforgiving.

    <p class="dsLastText"> 
      The game is played from a third-person perspective. Players control a customizable protagonist and the gameplay is focused on strategic weapons-based combat and exploration.
      Players battle varied enemies while using items such as swords and firearms, exploring different locations, interacting with non-player characters, and unraveling the city's mysteries.
      The game features new weapons, armor, and rings and new items called "Grains" which give players a temporary resistance to effects like poison, fire, and bleeding. As with the original,
      players are limited in how much they can carry before their character becomes encumbered, and some aspects of this encumbrance system have been adjusted. For example, in the original game,
      healing grasses have no weight, so players could potentially carry hundreds of them; in the remake, these healing items now have a weight associated with them so that the amount players can carry is significantly lessened,
      and more potent grasses weigh more than less effective ones.
      <br>
      <br>
      One new feature, called "Fractured World", is a mirror mode which reverses the layout of environments.The game also includes a photo mode, whereupon using it the game will pause,
      something not possible in the original. Filters from the photo mode can also be used during gameplay, including a "classic mode" filter intended to evoke the look of the original PlayStation 3 game.Although the Souls series is notorious for its difficulty,
      Bluepoint stated that the remake would not introduce different difficulty levels. The character creation feature has also been updated, with more options for customization. 
      <br>
      <br>
      In 2016, Hidetaka Miyazaki, the director of the original Demon's Souls, acknowledged the demand for a remake but said that because the IP belonged to Sony, 
      the inception of such a project would depend on their desire to do so. After Miyazaki and FromSoftware, the development studio of the original game, gave their approval, Bluepoint Games began development of a remake following completion of its' 2018 remake of Shadow of the Colossus. 
      SIE Japan Studio, who assisted with the development of the original game, also assisted Bluepoint Games for the remake. A core goal was to remain true to the original while making adjustments in line with the more advanced hardware. Using the original art assets, music and level design as a blueprint,
      the team wanted to "finetune" the experience so it would appeal to players accustomed to modern games.
      <br><br>
      The score of the original game was recorded digitally and this presented difficulties in updating it for a modern remake. As such, 
      the original score was redone in the style of Shunsuke Kida's original work, utilizing a full orchestra and choir.The voice acting was redone, 
      with many of the original cast returning to both re-record their old lines and voice new dialogue. The motion capture animations were also redone.
      The game utilizes the haptic functionality of the DualSense controller giving the feeling of [metal striking metal] or to aid in the timing parries.
      The game ships with two visual modes: "cinematic mode" running at a native 4K resolution, at 30 frames per second and "performance mode" with a dynamic 4K at 60 frames per second.
      Despite earlier claims, Demon's Souls will not support ray tracing. Though a recurring request was the realization of a supposed sixth zone represented by a broken teleport stone in the original, the team decided to leave the game's number of worlds as is
